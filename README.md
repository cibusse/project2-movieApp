# project2-movieApp


The app is a movie finder that connects to the FinnKino API to fetch up-to-date movie information.

Users can browse current movies showing in Finnish cinemas, view details about each film, and see showtimes.

The app retrieves data from the FinnKino API using HTTP requests, then dynamically displays the results on the web page.

The user interface is designed to be clear and simple, making it easy to search for movies and access information.

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with all logic running in the browser and no backend server required.
